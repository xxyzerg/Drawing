# Drawing program

This individual work is done by Java. I use Java IDE as a tool. There is a turtle on the ground holding a pen. User could enter “1” to let the pen up. Turtle puts down the pen once user enter “2”. Turtle turns right/left once user enter “3”/”4″. “5” means moving forward. In addition, user needs to enter the amount of spaces that turtle moves forward. “6” shows the result. The program completes once user click “9”.
